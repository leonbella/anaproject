    <h2>What Does a Movement Analyst Do?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) is the identifying language for movement description in disciplines that explore the domain of human movement behavior, in both function and expression.</p>
    <br>

<p>A movement analyst utilizes LMA/BF as a framework for enhancing movement experience, movement vocabulary and communication. Movement Analysts utilize their skills and knowledge in a variety of fields, including dance training and research, somatic practice, bodywork and physical therapy, theater arts and performance, all forms of movement education, research, choreography, fitness, corporate coaching, dance therapy and other clinical practices.</p>
<br>
<p>LMA/BF has given me a unique tool in which to do my work as a dance educator and somatic movement therapist.  It gives me a language that is fairly objective and removes judgement.  It gives me a scientific perspective in which to view, analyze, and interpret what I see so that my observations (analysis) can be of the most benefit to my students, clients, and patients. At the same time, I am able to keep my artistic integrity when observing and analyzing performance, art work or human movement. </p>
