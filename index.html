        <h1>Movement Never Lies</h1>
        <p> Although body movement is the common denominator of all human endeavor, it is ephemeral. It appears for an instant and then disappears, leaving only a trace in the mind of the observer. You can, however, learn to understand your movement and its inner and outer manifestations using the Laban Movement Analysis. Movement can be divided into four components: Body, Effort, Space and Shape in order to observe, analyze and re-pattern movement scientifically and efficiently. AB Coaching can help you better understand how and why you move to help you reach your fullest potential whether in business, fitness or for health.
